# 🌞 Proveway UI Assignment – BOGO Product Selector

This is a responsive and accessible frontend implementation of a **Buy One Get One (BOGO)** style product selector. The goal was to replicate a design (e.g., from Figma) as closely as possible using semantic HTML, custom CSS, and vanilla JavaScript – without any libraries or frameworks.
